Belows are the Python programs and Jupyter notebooks used in the project.

Before running the programs, call the Python command below to install the required libraries:
pip3 install -r py_libraries.txt

- Instructions:
  + Run the Jupyter notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb
  + Open the terminal and run the data sampling program using the command:
    python stratified_sampling.py
  + Call the main program and follow the instruction on the screen.
    python main.py


- Main program 
  Command: python main.py
  This program displays a menu with 3 options: 
  1) Build a new Decision Tree.
  2) View result of pre-built tree.
  3) Exit the program.

- Data sampling program
  Command: python stratified_sampling.py
  This program performs stratified data sampling on the pre-processed data.

- Python modules:
